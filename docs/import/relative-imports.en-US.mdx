 ### Relative Imports

Any import that begins with ./ or ../ is considered a relative import.

Relative imports reference a file located `relative` to the file that is importing it. This provides a mechanism for modularization (breaking up the logic into multiple files) and code forking (for example, importing different implementations of a function based on the shell interpreter).

### Implementation Details

Relative imports are made possible primarily because of the `Location` and/or `Content-Location` HTTP headers provided by the server that provides the imported URL.

When a script is imported, the HTTP headers are parsed, and the <b>final</b> `Location`/`Content-Location` header is considered the "location" of the script. This final URL gets cached to the filesystem in the `locations` directory.

### Example

Perhaps an example will help illustrate. If you inspect the response headers for the `tootallnate/hello`, then you can see the `content-location` header is present:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

curl -sI https://import.sh/tootallnate/hello | grep -i location
# content-location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tootallnate/hello/master/hello.sh
```

`import` keeps tracks of these URL locations, so that from within the `hello.sh` script, any relative import, let's say `import ./foo.sh`, will be normalized to relative of the current URL location.
