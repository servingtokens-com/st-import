 Creating an account is <strong>easy</strong>, and requires no <strong>card</strong> to <CustomLink href="http://localhost:3333/auth/register">register</CustomLink>.

Because import uses curl, you can use the standard .netrc file format to define your username and passwords to the server you are importing from.

For example, to make script files in private GitHub repos accessible, create a ~/.netrc file that contains something like:

```mdx
machine   raw.githubusercontent.com
login     231a4a02aeb1fbcf164f7c444ae5a211c1451d95
password  x-oauth-basic
```

The `login` token is a <CustomLink href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">GitHub "personal access token".</CustomLink> 


Follow the instructions in that link to create one for yourself.

After that, an import call to a private repo will work as expected:

```bash
import "my-organization/private-repo@1.0.0"
```

<Callout emoji="✅">
	Your GitHub credentials <b>ARE NEVER </b> given to the <strong>`import.sh`</strong> server. They are only used <strong className="italics">locally</strong> by  <strong>`curl`</strong> once the server redirects to the private repo URL.
</Callout>
